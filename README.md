## Code Description

After the initial splash screen, which had an image of the table columns, user can either add a new item with the floating button or insert dummy data.  There are two Activites:  CatalogActivity and EditoryActivity along with an InventoryCursorAdapter.

The CatalogActivity is for the main splash screen.  The EditorActivity is for editing the new and existing products in the inventory.  The InventoryCursorAdapter is used to pull the list together from the database.

Below are 4 screen shots with the splash screen, insertion of dummy data, editing a product and adding a product.
